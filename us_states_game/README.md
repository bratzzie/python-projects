# Day 25 - Working with CSV Data and the Pandas Library, U.S. States Game

An educational game, which gets you to guess and learn all the States in the US. The inspiration comes from a quiz on Sporcle, where it has a quite a similar game. 

In our program, when guessing another state and hitting OK, that name appears then on the map at the location of the state.

We can also exit the program by typing "Exit" in the input, and then, the CSV file with not yet uncovered states would be written to it.
