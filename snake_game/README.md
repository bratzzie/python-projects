## Objectives
+ To learn about class inheritance
+ To learn about slicing things like dictionaries and tuples.
+ To create a snake body, by creating three squares on the screen, all lined up next to each other.
+ To figure out how to move the snake so that it continuously moves forward.
+ To figure out how to control the snake using keyboard controls (using the up, left, down, and right arrow keys to move our
snake across the screen). 
+ To put some food onto the screen and detect the collision with the food so that once the snake hits the food,
then a new piece of food gets created randomly on the screen at some sort of random location.
+ To keep track of the score and create a scoreboard. Once the snake hits a piece of food, the score automatically updates.
+ To end game when the snake has collided with the wall. At this point we should see game over, show up on screen and the snake should no longer move.
+ To end game when the snake has collided with its own tail/other part of body.
