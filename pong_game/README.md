# Day 22 Pong: The Famous Arcade Game
Pong is a classic arcade game, probably one of the first arcade games that ever was. It's basically just a ball
that's going across a table and two players each control a paddle
bouncing the ball back and forth. If you miss the ball, then the other player scores a point.
