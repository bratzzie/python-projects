# Day 26 - List Comprehension and the NATO Alphabet

A simple console line application, which uses the NATO phonetic alphabets so that we can spell out various things on the telephone. 

For example, whenever you need to give your name, and you have to spell it out, people may misunderstand you.

So then we would say something like A for Alpha, B for Bravo, etc.
