## Objectives
+ To create a turtle player that starts at the bottom of the screen and listen for the "Up" keypress to move the turtle north.
+ To create cars that are 20px high by 40px wide that are randomly generated along the y-axis and move to the left edge of the screen. No cars should be generated in the top and bottom 50px of the screen (a safe zone).
+ To detect when the turtle player collides with a car and stop the game if this happens.
+ To detect when the turtle player has reached the top edge of the screen. When this happens, return the turtle to the starting position and increase the speed of the cars. 
+ To create a scoreboard that keeps track of which level the user is on. Every time the turtle player does a successful crossing, the level should increase. When the turtle hits a car, GAME OVER should be displayed in the centre.
